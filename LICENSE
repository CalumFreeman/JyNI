  modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under

JyNI is partly based on source-files from CPython 2.7.3, 2.7.4 and 2.7.5.
As such, it includes the common license of CPython 2.7.3, 2.7.4, 2.7.5
and Jython in the file "PSF-LICENSE-2". Whether a source-file
is directly based on CPython source-code is documented at the
beginning of each file.

For compliance with PSF LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR PYTHON 2, section 3,
the file "README" contains the required overview of
changes done to CPython-code in section 6.

A copy of the content of this file is provided in the file "README" in section 8.
